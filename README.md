# ELTE AI&ML Training's Final project repo
Final thesis project of Postgraduate specialization program: Mathematics expert in data analytics and machine learning at Eotvos Lorand University, Budapest HU.

Repo contains a long summary notebook with all functions and results together, linked to google colab. There are several shorter notebooks containing the data prep functions, the model architectures and the results separately. 

The models were trained on a personal PC with a RTX2060 GPU, this needed smaller batch sizes in the dataloader and smaller fully connected layers in the models. Trained models are saved in a folder.

Project summary PDF file is also added with no changes made compared to the file uploaded into Neptun system.

Future plans are to expand upon the models explored here and experiment with other architectures.
